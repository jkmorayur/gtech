          <h1>Dimensional Inspection</h1>
          <span> A closer look: verifying dimensional accuracy </span>
          <p>Dimensional inspection, also called dimensional metrology, assesses the geometric characteristics of parts and products to assure their compliance with design specifications. Dimensional inspection verifies the accuracy of product features that can affect reliability and functionality, and can be a critical step during product development or following production.</p>
          <span> The Dimensional Inspection Process </span>
          <img src="images/services_1.jpg" alt="" class="serviceimage"  >
          <p> For the highest degree of accuracy, we minimise factors that contribute to measurement uncertainty. Dimensional inspection services are performed in our environmentally controlled laboratory under regulated temperature and humidity conditions.</p>
          <p>Our dimensional metrology inspectors are thoroughly trained to interpret customer prints and use CMM inspection services and technology for timely, reliable and repeatable dimensional inspection measurements. We use Mitutoyo's CMM for our measurement for products of sizes up to 500x400x400 mm.</p>
          <p>We at GCLC perform dimensional inspection on surface and specialty features of machined parts and products, including internal and external fastener threads. First article inspection and third-party dimensional metrology services are performed according to NAS, MS and ANSI specifications. Our dimensional inspection and measurement capabilities are accredited to ISO/IEC 17025 by DAC (Dubai Accreditation Centre). All of the instrumentation used in the dimensional metrology lab is traceable to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).</p>

				<h1>Valve Testing</h1>
           		 <img src="images/services_2.jpg" alt="" class="serviceimageb"  >
          		 <p>Pressure safety valves are installed on process equipment to release excess pressure resulting from faulty process operations. Simply said, the safety valve   , exchangers, boilers and/or any other equipment.</p> 
<p>It is essential to maintain pressure safety valves and relief valves in good condition. Periodic testing is one of the most important elements of ensuring that the safety valves will provide this important protection. </p>
<p>The most desirable type of test is one that subjects the pressure relief valve to the full operating conditions that it is designed to endure in practice. Our system enables you to test your spring operated safety valves on site without interrupting the process operation. With this so called ‘hot testing’ the safety valve stays on-line and no dismantling of the valve or plant shut-down is required. </p>
